# CleverAlgorithms

The C++ implementation of [Clever Algorithms](https://github.com/clever-algorithms/CleverAlgorithms).

## Overview

**Clever Algorithms: Nature-Inspired Programming Recipes** is an open source book that describes a large number of algorithmic techniques from the the fields of Biologically Inspired Computation, Computational Intelligence and Metaheuristics in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner such that they are accessible, usable, and understandable. This is a repository for the source code (C++ implementation) of the book project.

## How to build the source code

```bash
gcc -g -Wall -std=c++11 <algorithm>.cpp -lstdc++ -o <algorithm>
```
